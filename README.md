# Bas-Emunun

I was bored. Wanted to get a feel for pygameâ€¦ this is a very simple and hackish (but it works i guess) boggle clone using "thaana"

needs a better dictionary, and better selection of what letter-vowel combination goes on the tiles. Right now, it's playable, but not very exciting because the words you can form are limited.
